Feature: relate entities using predefined relations
  In order to maximize normalization
  As a editor
  I want to relate entities

    Given I am logged in as "admin"
    And the setup "Bamberg"
    And I mark "Sankt Stephan" as current entity

    Then I should see "Bamberger Apokalypse"
    And I follow "Plus" within ".relationships"
    Then I should see "Bamberger Apokalypse" within ".canvas"
    And I should see "Sankt Stephan" within ".canvas"
    When I select "befindet sich in" from "relationship[relation_name]"
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should be on the entity page for "Bamberger Apokalypse"
    And I should see "Relationship has been created"
    And I should see "befindet sich in" within ".canvas"
    And I should see "Sankt Stephan" within ".canvas"

    And I follow "Plus" within "#properties"
    And I fill in "relationship[properties][]" with "Bibliothek"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should be on the entity page for "Bamberger Apokalypse"
    And I should see "Relationship has been changed"
    Then I should see "Bibliothek" within ".relationship .properties"

    And I follow the delete link within ".relationships"
    Then I should not see "befindet sich in" within ".relationships"
    And I should not see "Sankt Stephan" within ".relationships"
